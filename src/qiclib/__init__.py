"""qiclib is Quantum Interface's official Python client for the QiController.

This documentation aims to provide an overview over the provided functionality
of the QiController and its usage with the :python:`qiclib` Python package. As the
system is under active development, it might happen that some documentation is
not complete or lacking additional information. In this case, please feel free
to contact the developers or open an issue in the repository.

:python:`qiclib` is organized in several submodules providing different functionality.
For convenience. the following two objects are also directly accessible by
importing :python:`qiclib`:

* :class:`~qiclib.hardware.controller.QiController`:
    The heart of the client providing access to the QiController and all its configuration and
    control interface.
* :class:`~qiclib.experiment.collection`:
    A collection of descriptions for most common qubit experiments.
