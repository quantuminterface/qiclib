"""Generated interface files to communicate with the QiController via gRPC

This module contains the generated interface files for the gRPC remote
procedure calls. As they are completely encapsulated by the component classes
in `qiclib.hardware`, please look there for usage guidance.

The protobuf specification files used to generate the interface are located
within the git submodule beneath `./ipe_servicehub_protos`.

Regeneration requires the `grpcio-tools` to be installed from pip. Then, the
script `./grpc_generate.sh` can be called with specifying the location of the
protobuf specification files.
