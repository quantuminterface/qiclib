"""Generated interface files to communicate with the QiController via gRPC

This module contains the generated interface files for the gRPC remote
procedure calls. As they are completely encapsulated by the component classes
in `qiclib.hardware`, please look there for usage guidance.

The protobuf specification files used to generate the interface are located
within the git submodule `./ipe_servicehub_protos`.

The files are automatically generated as part of the build process
(i.e., when calling `pip install -U .`).
