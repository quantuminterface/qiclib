        The QiController driver

        The step size of tau in seconds.
    :param averages:
        The number of trace averages/repetitions to perform.

        If the background should be measured in parallel (two additional lists at record output; defaults to False)
    :param drive_offset:
        The delay between turning on the drive and starting the measurement.

    :param shift_result:
        Divides the result by 1^shift_result to prevent an overflow during averaging.
