        The QiController driver

        The step size of tau in seconds.

        The maximum value of tau in seconds.

        If the background should be measured in parallel (two additional lists at record output; defaults to False)

        The delay between turning on the drive and starting the measurement.

        Divides the result by 1^shift_result to prevent an overflow during averaging.
