    """Experiment to demonstrate quantum feedback by actively resetting the qubit to state \|0>
    by measuring it, applying a pi pulse if state is detected to be \|1>
    and finally performing another readout to check on the pulse.

    At the beginning, the qubit is prepared in state \|1>
    and some delay as in a T1 measurement is included.
    By performing this experiment twice, one time with valid stater config
    and once with some artificial values so the QiController detects the qubit always in state \|0>
    we can compare the normal T1 decay with an actively resetted version.
    If the states are perfectly separable and we have no response delay,
    we would simply get always state 0 after active reset.
    As this will most likely not be the case, at least a suppression should be visible
    compared to the normal T1.
