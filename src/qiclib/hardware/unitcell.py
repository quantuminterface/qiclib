"""This module contains the drivers to interface with the digital unit cells and the
cell coordinator on the QiController.

Different FPGA modules exist to generate and analyze microwave pulses, to persist data,
and to coordinate their execution in a well-defined sequence of operations with the
required precision and timing accuracy. These are bundled inside so-called digital unit
cells. Each of them contains all functionality required to interface a single
superconducting qubit. The microwave signals are digitally represented in the
complex-valued baseband as in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) components with 16 bit
resolution each. This enables arbitrary pulse shaping and full phase and sideband
control of the (later) up-converted signal. The FPGA processes four samples each cycle
(4 ns) to obtain a converter data rate of 1 GS/s (1 ns resolution).

.. image:: unitcell.png

The digital unit cell is structured as follows: Two signal generators create the
required pulses to control and read out the qubit. A signal recorder takes the digitized
signal from the ADC and demodulates it to obtain the qubit state. A dedicated data
storage collects the resulting data from the signal recorder and the sequencer. A
digital trigger block can generate digital signals to address and trigger external lab
equipment. All modules are controlled and activated by the sequencer which orchestrates
their execution in single-cycle steps (4 ns). For fast conditional responses, the signal
recorder directly reports all measured qubit states back to the sequencer which can then
act accordingly. In all other cases, the modules communicate exclusively via a Wishbone
bus that connects them. This also applies for trigger signals from the sequencer to
control the execution of the other modules.

For more information on the different modules within the digital unit cell, refer to:

* Sequencer: `qiclib.hardware.sequencer`
* Signal generator: `qiclib.hardware.pulsegen`
* Signal recorder: `qiclib.hardware.recording`
* Data storage: `qiclib.hardware.storage`

Each QiController contains multiple digital unit cells, so multi-qubit experiments can
be easily performed. The generated signals from the digital unit cells can be flexibly
routed to the DAC channels. It is possible to combine signals from multiple cells onto
the same DAC channel for frequency-division-multiplexed readout and control.

.. todo:: Add information on how this signal routing is performed / configured.
