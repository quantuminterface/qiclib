"""This module contains the drivers to interface with the QiController.

A general introduction into the QiController architecture is given in `qiclib.hardware`.

The `QiController` class is the interface to the platform and enables the user to
control it to any extend possible. This ranges from direct low-level access to the
different components up to high-level access using QiCode (see :mod:`qiclib.code`) and even
integration in other frameworks like Qiskit and Qkit.

A connection to the platform can be established by creating an instance of this class
and passing the ip address of the QiController. The class instance then provides access
to all the functionality of the platform.

.. todo:: Image with structure of QiController class.

.. image:: qicontroller.png

The QiController class contains multiple submodules, one for the Taskrunner, another one
for general status information by the platform information and management core (PIMC),
and a third one to represent the digital unit cells of the platform. Each unit cell
contains submodules for sequencer and signal recorder (called ``recording``), as well as
for the data storage and both signal generators (called ``readout`` and ``manipulation``
to distinguish between their intended usage).

Most accesses to the platform are realized using the getter/setter pattern where one
does not call any method explicitly but just assigns the values to the appropriate
property which will be transparently propagated to the QiController. Likewise, reading
out a value happens by simply accessing the property which will cause a network request
in the background whose result is then returned as value of the property. Only more
complex operations are implemented as methods to indicate that these operations might
cause some considerable overhead. The same applies for operations that not just
configure the modules but trigger an action, like starting or resetting a module.

Example
-------
Setting the pulse duration of the manipulation pulse stored in trigger set 12 of the
fifth digital unit cell is accomplished by:

.. code-block:: python

    qic = QiController("ip-address")  # Only needed once when initializing the board
    qic.cell[4].manipulation.triggerset[12].duration = 80e-9  # seconds (80 ns)

The assignment will then be handled within the :class:`qiclib.hardware.pulsegen.TriggerSet`
class where it is translated to a remote procedure call of the
:class:`qiclib.hardware.pulsegen.PulseGen` class that communicates with the QiController.
