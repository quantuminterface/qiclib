"""This module contains the drivers to control and interface with the QiController.

The QiController provides a versatile and flexible qubit control platform and is meant
to be used as laboratory equipment specifically designed to meet the demands of the
superconducting qubit research community. It consists of numerous different modules:
Taskrunner, cell coordinator, multiple digital unit cells, each with sequencer, signal
recorder and two signal generators, among others. All modules can be individually
controlled and configured to obtain the desired output and functionality.
In the following the architecture of the QiController is introduced in more detail.

Tasks which require nanosecond accuracy are handled within the FPGA.
There, the main functionality is provided by digital unit cells (see `qiclib.hardware.unitcell`).
They generate digital microwave pulses which are flexibly routed (i.e. combined and distributed) to the available DAC channels.
Likewise, returning digitized microwave signals from the ADCs are distributed and split up onto the belonging cells.
The cells are synchronized using a special cell coordinator which also facilitates data exchange between the cells.
On the processing system, online data processing and advanced control is implemented by the Taskrunner on a dedicated real-time processor.
A modular communication server called ServiceHub provides a user interface to interact with the platform via Ethernet.
This python driver encapsulates the remote procedure calls exposed by the ServiceHub (using the gRPC framework).

Experiments running on the QiController are normally all partitioned in a similar way.
Pulse generation, detection, sequencing and result storage, as well as simple parameter variations, happen with nanosecond precision in the digital unit cells in the FPGA.
Their execution is synchronized by the cell coordinator which is triggered by the Taskrunner.
The Taskrunner controls the execution of the FPGA, performs more complex parameter variations between multiple executions and collects the result data that is generated within the digital unit cells.
Also, further data aggregation, sorting or online evaluation are possible, depending on the requirements of the experiment.
This includes, but is not limited to, averaging of data, collection of individual qubit states or single measurement values, as well as counting different qubit state outcomes.
You can also define your own C program to perform custom data processing and aggregation (see `qiclib.hardware.taskrunner`).
The resulting data is then sent via the ServiceHub to the user client where you can either persist or further process the data offline.
During the experiment, in principle, no connection between client and QiController is required.
However, you can monitor the progress of the execution and, depending on the experiment, stream some result data already before the execution finished.

For more details on how to interact with the QiController, see `qiclib.hardware.controller`.
Details concerning the high-level experiment description language QiCode can be found in `qiclib.code`.
The functionalities covered by the digital unit cells within the FPGA are covered in `qiclib.hardware.unitcell`.
For more background regarding the online data processing and aggregation within the Taskrunner, refer to `qiclib.hardware.taskrunner`.
