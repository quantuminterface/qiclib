"""This module contains the driver to access the Platform Information and Management
Core/Controller (PIMC) on the hardware platform.

The PIMC is an FPGA module designed to provide standardized access and recognition of
different hardware images. It provides an interface to query the status of the running
image, as well as to perform a global reset operation. The status also includes a
project and a platform ID to identify the built hardware image and the platform for
which it is intended. This information can later be used by other software components to
check for compatibility with the system (like this driver). It also provides information
of the build revision as well as the timestamp when the FPGA firmware was created.
A busy flag indicates if the platform is currently performing an operation.
A ready flag tells the user if the platform is fully initialized and ready to use.
This includes a check if all clocks are configured and running correctly, and if the
connection to the converters is established and working.
