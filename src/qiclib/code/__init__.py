This package provides everything related to coding with `QiCode`.
From this package, everything required to write QiCode can be imported.
For convenience, one usually star-imports everything from this module, i.e.

.. code-block:: python

    from qiclib.code import *

to have access to all QiCode Commands.

Additionally, this package also contains the compiler that transforms `QiCode` into binary code
that is fed to the QiController.
