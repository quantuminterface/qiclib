"""
The mocks package provides means to easily mock hardware components resp. the grpc service stubs of these components.
The intended usage is with the `patch()` function from `unittest`, for example:

```
from unittest import patch
from mocks import pimc


@patch("qiclib.packages.grpc.pimc_pb2_grpc.PIMCServiceStub", new=pimc.MockPIMCService)
def test_something_that_uses_the_pimc_module(): ...  # In this function, all calls to the PIMC service are replaced by the mock pimc service
```

For easier development, all mocked modules contain a `patch` function to replace their 'real' counterpart, i.e.

```
from mocks import pimc


@pimc.patch()
def test_something_that_uses_the_pimc_module(): ...  # Same as above
```

The `patch` function from the mocks module can be mock multiple modules, i.e. this
```
@pimc.patch()
@pulse_gen.patch()
@recording.patch()
...
def test_something():
    ... # Test something that uses many hardware component, for example a `QiJob`
```

is equivalent to the following:
```
@mocks.patch(pimc, pulse_gen, recording, ...)
def test_something(): ...  # Test something that uses many hardware component, for example a `QiJob`
```
